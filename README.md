# Checkout Extensibility extensions upgrade for Threadwallets 2.0

## Requirements

1. node.js
1. Partner account
1. You must create a store for testing if you don't have one, either a [development store](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/dashboard/development-stores#create-a-development-store) or a [Shopify Plus sandbox store](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/dashboard/managing-stores/plus-sandbox-store).

### Installing the template


Using npm:

```shell
npm init @shopify/app@latest
```

### Local Development

[The Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/tools/cli) connects to an app in your Partners dashboard. It provides environment variables, runs commands in parallel, and updates application URLs for easier development.

You can develop locally using your preferred package manager. Run one of the following commands from the root of your app.

Using npm:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Open the URL generated in your console. Once you grant permission to the app, you can start development.
